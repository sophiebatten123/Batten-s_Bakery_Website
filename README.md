# Overview

[Batten's Bakery]() is a Bakery Website aimed at enticing customers to book in for its famous afternoon tea. It promotes delicious cakes and scrumptious pasteries with an added lockdown twist at the companies request to allow its customers to bake their favourites whilst in the comfort of their own home. Batten's Bakery caters for many dietery requirements including vegatarian, vegan and gluten free options in all its recipes.

The site itself is fully responsive and deisgned in a simplistic and easy to navigate manner. It has been coded using solely HTML and CSS due to this being my first project and therefore although it has 'form' elements on the website, due to no back-end fuctionality the entered fields will not be sent anywhere.
